Abstract:

This paper introduces a groundbreaking approach to incorporate subjectivity and broad context-dependency in text analysis. Our method integrates subjectivity
 through a computational iteration of Marvin Minsky's Framework Theory (1974) utilizing text vectorization, such as Word2Vec by Mikolov et al. (2013).
  The context-aware embeddings produced by the vectorization are subsequently employed in text analysis. Our approach rests on three elements: 
  1)  a framework or "room" symbolizing the viewpoint of an individual or group, 2) a benchmark or set of keywords representing the analysis criteria, and
   3) the document under analysis. By calculating the similarity among vectors that represent words or semantic elements, we extract the relative significance of 
  the elements in the benchmark for the document under analysis. Our technique offers a means to consider the reader's viewpoint or the specific domain we aim to gain insights from. 
  The method is applicable in all instances where evaluating subjectivity is crucial for understanding a text's relative value or meaning. Subjectivity is key to assessing human 
  reactions or analyzing text within a specific context or domain.

Introduction:
Subjectivity refers to the concept that every individual's (or collective's) opinion is shaped by their socio-cultural experiences. These experiences shape each person's unique interpretation of 
their environment and impact various aspects of human life. For example, political subjectivity entails the thoughts, motivations, and feelings that an individual has within society, 
often determining their political ideology bias (Ransom, 1997). According to Damasio (2018), subjectivity is the fundamental constitutive element of consciousness, enabling reflection,
 discernment, and creativity.

Subjectivity is also intertwined with emotions, as Harr√© (1986) emphasized that emotions are the outcome of a social construction mechanism. Anthropologist Tanya M. Luhrmann (2006) 
proposed a theory of subjectivity supported by a psychological model of emotion. Emotional responses are the result of an individual's perception of external stimuli and, due to subjectivity,
 this response varies from person to person.

Subjectivity has a significant impact on various human activities, and criteria for determining it can be applied to assess the relative relevance of a context for text evaluation. 
In this paper, we present a test case to validate our approach to assessing subjectivity in text analysis by examining emotional reactions to a contentious political topic. 
For this purpose, we use emotions as an example of criteria for subjective classifications, underscoring that emotions, a quintessential instance of subjectivity, represent "what" we aim to evaluate, 
not "how".

More broadly, our approach to subjectivity can be applied in all instances where a context-dependent analysis is necessary. Later, we will discuss the use of this approach to
 classify documents based on a particular viewpoint. To contextualize the emotions, we employed the emotion classification created by Plutchik in 1980.
